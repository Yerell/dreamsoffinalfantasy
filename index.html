            is a Japanese role-playing game series with varying gameplay,
            settings and stories between each installment, retaining plot and

            franchise, it has branched into other genres, such as MMORPGs,

            games. The series has been distributed on many platforms, beginning
            with the Nintendo Entertainment System, and including consoles,
            computers, mobile operating systems and game streaming services. The
            series has also branched into other forms of media, particularly

            Three Final Fantasy installments were released on the Nintendo
            Entertainment System (NES). Final Fantasy was released in Japan in
            1987 and in North America in 1990. It introduced many concepts to
            the console RPG genre, and has since been remade on several
            platforms. Final Fantasy II, released i n 1988 in Japan, has been
            bundled with Final Fantasy in several re-releases. The last of the
            NES installments, Final Fantasy III, was released in Japan in 1990;
            however, it was not released elsewhere until a Nintendo DS remake in
            2006.The Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) also featured
            three installments of the main series, all of which have been
            re-released on several platforms. Final Fantasy IV was released in
            1991; in North America, it was released as Final Fantasy II. It
            introduced the "Active Time Battle" system. Final Fantasy V,
            released in 1992 in Japan, was the first game in the series to spawn
            a sequel: a short anime series, Final Fantasy: Legend of the
            Crystals.Final Fantasy VI was released in Japan in 1994, titled
            Final Fantasy III in North America.

            The PlayStation console saw the release of three main Final Fantasy games.
            Final Fantasy VII (1997) moved away from the two-dimensional (2D) graphics
            used in the first six games to three-dimensional (3D) computer graphics; 
            the game features polygonal characters on pre-rendered backgrounds. 
            It also introduced a more modern setting, a style that was carried over
            to the next game. It was also the second in the series to be released in 
            Europe, with the first being Final Fantasy Mystic Quest. 
            Final Fantasy VIII was published in 1999, and was the first to consistently 
            use realistically proportioned characters and feature a vocal piece as its
            theme music Final Fantasy IX, released in 2000, returned to the series
            roots by revisiting a more traditional Final Fantasy setting rather than 
            the more modern worlds of VII and VIII.

            Three main installments, as well as one online game, were published
            for the PlayStation 2 (PS2). Final Fantasy X (2001) introduced full
            3D areas and voice acting to the series, and was the first to spawn
            a sub-sequel (Final Fantasy X-2, published in 2003). The first
            massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) in the
            series, Final Fantasy XI, was released on the PS2 and PC in 2002,
            and later on the Xbox 360. It introduced real-time battles instead
            of random encounters. Final Fantasy XII, published in 2006, also
            includes real-time battles in large, interconnected playfields. The
            game is also the first in the main series to utilize a world used in
            a previous game, namely the land of Ivalice, which had previously
            featured in Final Fantasy Tactics and Vagrant Story.

            In 2009, Final Fantasy XIII was released in Japan, and in North
            America and Europe the following year, for PlayStation 3 and Xbox
            360. It is the flagship installment of the Fabula Nova Crystallis
            Final Fantasy series and became the first mainline game to spawn two
            sub-sequels (XIII-2 and Lightning Returns). It was also the first
            game released in Chinese and high definition along with being
            released on two consoles at once. Final Fantasy XIV, a MMORPG, was
            released worldwide on Microsoft Windows in 2010, but it received
            heavy criticism when it was launched, prompting Square Enix to
            rerelease the game as Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn, this time
            to the PlayStation 3 as well, in 2013. Final Fantasy XV is an action
            role-playing game that was released for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One
            in 2016. Originally a XIII spin-off titled Versus XIII, XV uses the
            mythos of the Fabula Nova Crystallis series, although in many other
            respects the game stands on its own and has since been distanced
            from the series by its developers.The next mainline entry, Final
            Fantasy XVI, was announced in September 2020 for the PlayStation 5.

Final Fantasy has been very influential in the history of video game mechanics. 
Final Fantasy IV is considered a milestone for the genre, introducing a dramatic
storyline with a strong emphasis on character development and personal relationships.
Final Fantasy VII is credited as having the largest industry impact of the series, 
and with allowing console role-playing games to gain mass-market appeal. 
Final Fantasy VII is considered to be one of the most important and influential
video games of all time.
The series affected Square's business on several levels. The commercial failure of
 Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within resulted in hesitation and delays from Enix
  during merger discussions with Square. Square's decision to produce 
  games exclusively for the Sony PlayStation—a move followed by Enix's decision with
   the Dragon Quest series—severed their relationship with Nintendo. Final Fantasy games
    were absent from Nintendo consoles, specifically the Nintendo 64, for seven years. 
    Critics attribute the switch of strong third-party games like the Final Fantasy and 
    Dragon Quest games to Sony's PlayStation, and away from the Nintendo 64, as one of
     the reasons behind PlayStation being the more successful of the two consoles. 
     The release of the Nintendo GameCube, which used optical disc media, in 2001 
     caught the attention of Square. To produce games for the system, Square created 
     the shell company The Game Designers Studio and released Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles,
      which spawned its own metaseries within the main franchise. Final Fantasy XI's 
      lack of an online method of subscription cancellation prompted the creation of legislation 
      in Illinois that requires internet gaming services to provide such a method to the state's residents.
The series' popularity has resulted in its appearance and reference in numerous facets of
 popular culture like anime, TV series, and webcomics.Music from the
  series has permeated into different areas of culture. Final Fantasy IV's
  "Theme of Love" was integrated into the curriculum of Japanese school children
   and has been performed live by orchestras and metal bands. In 2003, Uematsu
    co-founded The Black Mages, an instrumental rock group independent of Square
     that has released albums of arranged Final Fantasy tunes. Bronze medalists
      Alison Bartosik and Anna Kozlova performed their synchronized swimming routine
       at the 2004 Summer Olympics to music from Final Fantasy VIII. Many of the
        soundtracks have also been released for sale. Numerous companion books, which
         normally provide in-depth game information, have been published. In Japan, 
         they are published by Square and are called Ultimania books.
The series has inspired numerous game developers. Fable creator Peter Molyneux considers 
Final Fantasy VII to be the RPG that "defined the genre" for him. BioWare founder 
Greg Zeschuk cited Final Fantasy VII as "the first really emotionally engaging game" 
he played and said it had "a big impact" on BioWare's work. The Witcher 3 senior 
environmental artist Jonas Mattsson cited Final Fantasy as "a huge influence" and said it
 was "the first RPG" he played through. Mass Effect art director Derek Watts 
 cited Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within as a major influence on the visual design 
 and art direction of the series. BioWare senior product manager David Silverman 
 cited Final Fantasy XII's gambit system as an influence on the gameplay of Dragon Age: Origins.
 Ubisoft Toronto creative director Maxime Beland cited the original Final Fantasy
  as a major influence on him. Media Molecule's Constantin Jupp credited
   Final Fantasy VII with getting him into game design.[ Tim Schafer also cited 
   Final Fantasy VII as one of his favourite games of all time.
